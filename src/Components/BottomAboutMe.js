                        At my core I am technically and practically oriented. I
                        follow logic and reasoning to automate tasks so as to
                        not repeat mundane processes. I am passionate about
                        building programs and getting it right the first time. I
                        want to work more with React, and potentially React
                        Native. I want to build projects using the AWS
                        infrastructure. I am very enthusastic about learning to
                        better myself as a developer. Anything I don't know, I
                        will figure it out.
